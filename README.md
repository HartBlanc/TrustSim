This repo extends the model presented by Smaldino (2013) to answer whether, and under what circumstances, an element of reciprocity, or earned trust, is beneficial to cooperative agents. This report extends the Spatial Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma game to include adaptive agents which choose to co-operate more frequently if their past interactions indicate that partners will reciprocate. We test the hypothesis that an increase in the initial proportion of adaptive agents significantly decreases the long-term proportion of rational agents. We also explore the effect of using both long and short term memory.
